# TTR Launcher
A simple CLI launcher for Toontown Rewritten.

## About
Originally written by [Omeryl](https://github.com/Omeryl), it's been
extensively rewritten by me ([loganswartz](https://github.com/loganswartz))
Supports macOS, Linux (snap package and regular version), and Windows, without
all the weird crashes or behavior of the official launcher.

## Usage
Assuming the `ttr_launcher` folder is in your PYTHONPATH:
```bash
~ $ python3 -m ttr_launcher
```
